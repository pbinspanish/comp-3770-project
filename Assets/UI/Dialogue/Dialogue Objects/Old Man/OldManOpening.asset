  dialogueText:
  - They attacked just after night struck. I'm surprised you managed to sleep through
    it.
  - There have been passing rumours of Vermal's armies ravaging the land. It seems
    the King's armies weren't enough to stop his forces...
  - 'Our own Aretbrot, your father, fell defending the village. Even despite his
    knightly training, those vile creatures took him and retreated back into the
    woods. '
  - 'This isn''t good! Those beasts could return at any moment, and we would be useless
    to stop them. '
  - We need you to deal with them. I saw them take Aretbrot into the woods north
    of here. You could head that way to find where they took him. If you're lucky,
    he might have dropped his sword in case anyone came looking for him. Praise be
    to Bront those creatures didn't notice.
