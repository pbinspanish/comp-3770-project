  dialogueText:
  - "I\u2019d recognize that blade anywhere. I take it you succeeded then. Well done!"
  - "I always knew you had the potential to live up to Aretbrot, and it seems you\u2019ve
    done a great job of proving I was right."
  - "We\u2019re not out of the woods yet, however. Vermal\u2019s armies still ravage
    the areas around here, and we can\u2019t allow that to go on. Did you find any
    clues as to his whereabouts?"
  - "Ah, I see. Vermal went further north, and left an impenetrable wall of thorns
    behind him. And your sword couldn\u2019t cut them? Terrifying. I wonder what
    you could use to get through those."
  - "That\u2019s it! Rumour has it there is an enchantment of flame somewhere around
    here. I know Aretbrot would often spend time looking in the forests around here
    for it."
  - 'Unfortunately the forest to the east, the beach to the south and the mine to
    the north are all blocked off. See if you can explore around and try to find
    this enchantment, maybe to the west. '
  - "Go on off now, there isn\u2019t a moment to waste!"
