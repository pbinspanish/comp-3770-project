  - You nasty fool! You really thought I would help you defeat the dark lord?! My
    own father!
  - Well actually, he's not really my father. You see. But he could very well adopt
    me if I help him kill you! What I've given you is poison. And you've got exactly
    one minute to live. You'll never get your hands on the antidote! Muahahahaha!
